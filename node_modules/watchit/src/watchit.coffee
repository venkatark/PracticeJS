# Options:
# * `retain` means that if something is later created at the same location
# as the target, the new entity will be watched.
# * `debounce` means that changes that occur within 1 second of each other
# will be treated as a single change. This also allows "echo" events that
# occur under OS X to be ignored.
# * `include` means that if the target is a directory, files contained in that
# directory will be treated like targets. (Otherwise, directory events will
# be forwarded directly from `fs.watch`.)
# * `recurse` means that if the target is a directory, all of its
# subdirectories will also be counted as targets.
# * `persistent` is identical to `fs.watch`'s `persistent` option. If
# disabled, the process may exit while files are being watched.
# * `ignore` could contain RegExp pattern or function against which
# added files will be tested.
